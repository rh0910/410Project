# This directory does not contain any functional programs

All contentes in every sub directories present in this directory contain template and sample code for developing an application based on Flutter and dart, for our project. Majority of the files and code was generated using the `at_app` and `at_demos` repositories found in this [link](https://github.com/atsign-foundation), the repositories are pinned. Other files include configuration settings for the Java JDK and Android SDK.

This was my first time attempting to create an application for mobile devices and I was unable to get any functionality. When run on an emulator, the application would cause the emulator to crash and stop responding. That is all.
