The App.java is maven project. It contains code that is meant to recieve data. We first used this to test if we can actually recieve data from the pico board. Once we could tell that the data was recieved. We transfered some of the code to Application.java.

Application.java is the app for our project. It takes the data and outputs it with a gui. We could not figure out how to use flutter so we used that instead as an alternative.
