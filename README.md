# 410Project
We tried
# Project objective:
Peer-to-peer communication system to exchange information about
the presence of an object and whether a collision has occured
with this object. Driving software developed with the help of
java libraries and API along with the help of the @sign foundation and API.

# Hardware equipment required for operational results: 
Below is the list of required hardware components needed for this project.
It is essential to set up the equipment properly. The resistors and LED lights
serve for debugging purposes and thus the device will work without them.
The list below is given in the order of: `name of part` and `count`

1.  Raspberry Pi Pico W, 1
2.  Pico Headers, 1
3.  Solderless Breadboards (ALT), 1      
4.  PCs Jumper Wires, 10
5.  Resistors, 10
6.  (1, 8) Active Buzzer Module, 1
7.  (1, 16) Collision Sensor, 2
8.  (1, 9) Passive Buzzer Module, 1
9.  (2, 35) Infrared Obstacle Avoidance, 2    
10. (1, 7) Knock sensor Module, 2	

# Software requirements: 

OS: From Windows 7 upto Windows 10
Library: 
Java: Any version of Java JDK LTS from version 8.0 to 17.0
@foundation: The libraries from the @sign foundation, specifically
AtClient, AtSign, KeyBuilders, Keys, Keys.PublicKeys.
Libraries can be found on the @sign github repository [here](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/)

Project Details:
"Sense for a collision and send the data between two atSigns.
One atSign will be the device and the other atSign will 
be displaying the data on an application."

#  insert how to set up device *

Two operational computer systems, any OS is fine, are needed.
On one computer, we need to verify stable internet connection.
Make sure that your firewall allows the device to access the internet
through the connected computer.


the "Application.java" file found in the 
root directory of this repository can be run t
